Bonk Bot takes 1 % fees on each Tx and distributes it amoung various entities
No Fees on deposits

1 % on every swap tx ( eg if a user is creating a position of 100$ then 50$ will be swapped to token X,we take 0.5 $ in fees)
Lping is free
when user closes position and swaps back to sol,we take same 1 % fees there
No fees in profit or loss

10% of fees generated in a month goes to burning/staking M3M3.

For every 100$ we earn 1$ in fees.
Expect a user to do 2 trades,2$ in fees per day
expect a user to use the bot 15 days, thats 30$ in fees per user
if we have 100 users with same capital
we generate 3000$ in fees

now if we consider 1000$,then it's an extra zero,30,000$/month.
