We reserve the right to amend these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. When changes are made, we will update the "last updated" date and notify you through [www.docs.metengine.xyz](https://www.docs.metengine.xyz) and MetEngine’s official social channels (e.g., Discord). Your continued use of MetEngine after such updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

If you do not agree with these Terms, you must immediately stop using MetEngine.

## 1. MetEngine Features

### 1.1 Overview

MetEngine is a Telegram bot that enables users to provide liquidity ("LP") on the Meteora platform within the Solana network through a Telegram interface. The Company reserves the right to add or remove features at any time without prior notice.

### 1.2 Initialization

Before using MetEngine, you must create an inbuilt Solana wallet using the `/start` command. This wallet will be used for liquidity provision. Currently, the only bot available on Telegram is **@met_engine_bot**.

### 1.5 MetEngine Wallet

The private key to your MetEngine Wallet remains in your self-custodied possession. You are solely responsible for securely storing your private key and any associated passwords ("Security Credentials").

We do not have access to your Security Credentials or crypto assets. We cannot recover, restore, or retrieve them. You acknowledge that the integrity and security of your assets depend on your device and your maintenance of those credentials.
