## 1. MET ENGINE Features

### 1.2 Initialization

Before using Met Engine, you must create an inbuilt Solana wallet using the `/start` command. This wallet will be used for liquidity provision. Currently, the only bot available on Telegram is **@met_engine_bot**.

The private key to your Met Engine Wallet remains in your self-custodied possession. You are solely responsible for securely storing your private key and any associated passwords ("Security Credentials").

We do not have access to your Security Credentials or crypto assets. We cannot recover, restore, or retrieve them. You acknowledge that the integrity and security of your assets depend on your device and your maintenance of those credentials.
