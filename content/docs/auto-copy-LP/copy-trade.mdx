#### **1. Fixed Amount**
Always trade with the same SOL amount for each position.
- Example: Set 0.5 SOL ‚Üí Every trade uses exactly 0.5 SOL

#### **2. Portfolio %**
Trade with a percentage of your current SOL balance.
- Example: Set 10% ‚Üí If you have 5 SOL, trade with 0.5 SOL per position

#### **3. Copy Trader Position %**
Copy a percentage of the target's trade amount.
- Example: Target trades 1 SOL ‚Üí Set 50% ‚Üí You trade 0.5 SOL
- This is amount-based: percentage of their actual trade size

#### **4. Same Proportion**
Mirror the same proportion of target's portfolio allocation.
- Example: Target trades 10 SOL from their 100 SOL wallet (10% of portfolio) ‚Üí You automatically trade 10% of YOUR portfolio

#### **5. Same Amount**
Copy the exact same SOL amount as the target trader.
- Example: Target trades 1 SOL ‚Üí You also trade 1 SOL

#### **Max Amount Feature**
For options that depend on the trader's strategy (Copy Trader Position %, Same Proportion, Same Amount), you can set a Max Amount to limit your risk.
- Example: If you set Max Amount to 2 SOL and the trader opens a 10 SOL position:
  - With "Same Amount" selected, you'd only use 2 SOL instead of 10 SOL
  - With "Copy Trader Position %" at 50%, you'd use 2 SOL instead of 5 SOL
  - With "Same Proportion", you'd be capped at 2 SOL regardless of the calculated proportion

The Max Amount acts as a safety cap on individual positions to protect your funds from unexpectedly large trades.

## **Step 6: Stop Copy Trading (Optional)**
Click on the `Stop Copy trade` button to stop copying trades from all enabled wallets.
This will disable copy trading but allow you to continue receiving LP position notifications from added wallets.
