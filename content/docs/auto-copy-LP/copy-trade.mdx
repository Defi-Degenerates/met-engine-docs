title: Auto Copy LP Positions
---

Met Engine now lets you Auto-Copy one wallet‚Äôs LP positions in real time with **millisecond-level precision**. 
Set it once, and every move they make is mirrored automatically - no clicks, no lag.

And with our new **Spy Feature**, you can:

- ‚Å†Monitor 2 wallets in real time
- ‚Å†Manually copy from those if you spot something worth mimicking

**Auto one. Spy two. LP like a shadow.**

Add any wallet you'd like to track using this format:  
**`WalletName WalletAddress`**  
For example: `AlphaWallet 5F3sa2TJ...`

## **Step 4: Set a Primary Wallet**
Tap the ‚úÖ icon next to the wallet you want to auto-copy. This will mark it as your primary wallet to mirror.

- You will receive LP notifications (open/close position) when any of your tracked wallets take any `LP positions`.
- MetEngine will only copy LP positions from the wallet you've marked as primary.

## Step 5: Set a Custom SOL amount
Set the amount of SOL that should be used for each LP position. 

Example: 
If you set the custom amount as 5 SOL and your balance is 20 SOL, whenever your primary wallet opens a position, MetEngine will mirror it using 5 SOL.
- If the primary wallet opens 10 positions with 1 SOL each, your bot will copy the first 2 with 5 SOL each.
- Setting your custom SOL amount is required each time you add a new wallet.

## **Step 6: Stop Copy Trading (Optional)**
Click on the `Stop Copy trade` button to stop copying trades from the primary wallet.<br/>  
This will disable copy trading but allow you to continue receiving LP position notifications from added wallets.

‚úÖ You're All Set!

Once your **primary wallet** opens a new LP position, MetEngine will automatically:

- Open the same position for you using **your preset SOL amount**
- Close your position as soon as the primary wallet closes theirs

> üí° **Note:** Only the primary wallet's positions will be copied, MetEngine will not copy positions from any other added addresses.
