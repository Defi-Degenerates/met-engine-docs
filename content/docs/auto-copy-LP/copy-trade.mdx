- You will receive LP notifications(Open position and close position) whenever the other 2 wallets take any `LP position`.

## ‚úÖ You're All Set!

Whenever your **primary wallet** opens a new LP position, MetEngine will automatically:

- Open the same position for you using **your custom set amount**
- Close your position as soon as the primary wallet closes theirs

> üí° **Note:** Only primary wallet's positions will be copied, MetEngine won't take positions of other added addresses.
