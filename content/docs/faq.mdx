### What does an open/close position mean and should I swap the token manually?
When you enter a token address into DLMM, the bot automatically swaps 50% of your SOL to the specified token using Jupiter for optimal pricing. When closing the position, it swaps the tokens and any generated fees back to SOL.

### Are there any additional fees beyond the SOL requirement?
There are no hidden fees. You only pay standard Jupiter and Meteora fees as applicable. We sometimes apply market priority fees (e.g., Jito tips) for faster transaction execution, but you won't be charged anything extra by Met Engine.

  <li>Choose "Import Wallet" or "Restore from private key."</li>
  <li>Paste the exported private key.</li>
  <li>Follow on-screen instructions to complete setup.</li>
</ol>
