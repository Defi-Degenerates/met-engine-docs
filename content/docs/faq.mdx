There are no additional fees at the moment. The cost is equivalent to what any user would pay when using Jupiter and Meteora directly, and the fees depend on those platforms.

We do use market priority fees as required, leveraging RPCs and Jito tips to ensure better transaction execution. However, there are no hidden fees anywhere in the bot.
