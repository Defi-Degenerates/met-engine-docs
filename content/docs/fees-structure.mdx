<Callout>Auto-copy LPing is currently free while in beta, including opening/closing positions, swaps (Jupiter charges a 0.1% fee for Ultra swaps), and fees on earned yield.</Callout>

### Fees for Manually Opened LP positions (Not Auto Trade):

**1.5% LP Opening Fee** : A flat fee charged when opening an LP position **manually**. This unlocks access to premium features including **fee claiming**, **wallet tracking**, **position monitoring**, **impermanent loss tracking**, **market cap insights**, and **one-click exits**.

**0% Swap Fees** : All LP transactions use Jupiter Ultra to ensure low slippage and **protection from MEV**.

**0% Fee on Earned Yield** : You keep 100% of the fees generated from your LP positions.

**0% LP Closing Fee** : Close positions, claim rewards, and exit to SOL without any additional charges.


Met Engineâ€™s infra relies on high-performance servers, multiple RPCs for redundancy, continuous development, and ongoing UX improvements. Our fee model is designed to cover these costs while keeping the platform affordable, transparent and built to scale.
