| Position Size | Fee |
| ------------- | --- |
| 0-10 SOL      | 0.4% |
| 10-25 SOL     | 0.35% |
| 25-50 SOL     | 0.3% |
| 50-75 SOL     | 0.25% |
| 75+ SOL       | 0.2% |

<Callout>**5-Minute Cooldown Period** : A cooldown period of 5 minutes per pool applies to prevent charging of fees on multiple re-openings of positions in same pool. (Applicable to Auto Copy LP only)</Callout>

If you try to close and reopen a position in the same DLMM pool within 5 minutes, NO ADDITIONAL FEES will be charged. After 5 minutes has passed, opening a new position will be treated as a fresh transaction with normal fees structure.
