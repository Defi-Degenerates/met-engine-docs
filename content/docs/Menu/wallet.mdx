<Callout>ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Top up at least **0.2 SOL** if you're testing â€” this covers LP creation, Meteora rent, swap fees, and position open/close on Meteora.</Callout>

Below is an example of how the wallet looks. *(The UX will be updated as we add more features.)*.
<img src="/wallet-main.png" width="500" height="500"></img>

- A **fresh wallet** is automatically generated for every new user.
- Itâ€™s just like any other Solana wallet â€” you can even use it as your day-to-day wallet if you like.
- All your DLMM positions are routed through this wallet.
- Since this wallet makes Meteora positions, it also **farms MET points** passively for every dollar generated in fees.
- Use the **Top Pools** section to discover trending pools.
- Track **MET points** earned by your wallet on [Geekladâ€™s website](https://geeklad.github.io/meteora-profit-analysis/).
- Once the Meteora airdrop launches, you'll be able to check eligibility using this wallet â€” and if eligible, **claim it by exporting your private key**.
- You can export your private key at any time using the `/wallet` command.

<Callout>We use `end-to-end symmetric encryption` algorithms to ensure your private keys remain `encrypted` both locally and during transit.The only way someone could access your wallet is if your Telegram account is `compromised`.</Callout>
