- We don't want you to give us your private key to use our bot, for every user We generate a fresh wallet which they can top up and use to make their DLMM positions.
- It's just like any Other solana wallet you can also use it as your day-to-day wallet if you feel like it.
- As the wallet is making meteora positions, indirectly it is also farming MET points for every $ in fees generated  which makes it eligible for the Meteora Airdrop.
- In future you can check the eligibility of this wallet for the Meteora Airdrop and if it's eligible, you can claim the airdrop by exporting the private key.
- You can export the private key by using the `/wallet` command.

<Callout>Top up atleast 0.2 SOL if you are testing to cover the LP position + Meteora Rent + swap fees + Openiong and closing position on Meteora.</Callout>
