<Callout>Top up atleast 0.2 SOL if you are testing to cover the LP position + Meteora Rent + swap fees + Openiong and closing position on Meteora.</Callout>

Below is an Image of how the wallet looks like (The UX will be updated in the future as we add more features to it).

- For every new user we generate a fresh wallet.
- It's just like any other solana wallet, you can also use it as your day-to-day wallet if you feel like it.
- All your DLMM positions will be happening through this wallet.
- As the wallet is making meteora positions, indirectly it is also farming MET points for every $  generated in fees.
- Check `MET points` generated by the bot wallet on [Geeklad's website](https://geeklad.github.io/meteora-profit-analysis/).
- In future you can check the eligibility of this wallet for the Meteora Airdrop and if it's eligible, you can claim the airdrop by exporting the private key.
- You can export the private key by using the `/wallet` command.

<Callout>We use `end-to-end symmetric encryption` algorithms to ensure your private keys remain `encrypted` both locally and during transmission.The only way someone could access your wallet is if your Telegram account is `compromised`.</Callout>
