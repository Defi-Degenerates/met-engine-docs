Copy Trading made easy.
- Just enter the address whose positions you want to copy .
- The bot will show you all his active positions and further you can select which of these positions you want to copy from.
- Currently we are creating a new spot position with the current binstep range.
- In future you can copy the position with their range and automatically open & close the position when the address does so.
