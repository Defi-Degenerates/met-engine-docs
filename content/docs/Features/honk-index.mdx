#### <b>Each metric tells a story:</b>
- Pools → # of viable DLMM pools in last 15 mins
- Imb → % of swaps going into top 20% pools 
- 1d Vol → Last 24h volume in viable pools
- 1d TVL → Change in TVL in viable pools
- 1d Fees → Fees earned, avg over last 4 data points
- 1d Yield → 1d Fees/1d TVL (Yield % on LP capital)

#### <b>How to Use It for LPing?</b>

- Pools UP? More opportunities = healthier LP environment.
- 1d Yield > 3%? LPing is good to go despite fee dips.
- Imb DOWN? This is bullish—swaps are more evenly balanced across pools, reducing risk and creating more stable LP earnings.
- Imb HIGH? Means most volume is in just a few pools— it's imbalanced, be selective.
- 1d Vol DOWN? Could mean the market is slowing.
