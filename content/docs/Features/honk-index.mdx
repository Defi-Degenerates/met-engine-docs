#### How to Read the Honk Index?

Each metric tells a story:

- Pools → # of viable DLMM pools in last 15 mins
- Imb → % of swaps going into top 20% pools 
- 1d Vol → Last 24h volume in viable pools
- 1d TVL → Change in TVL in viable pools
- 1d Fees → Fees earned, avg over last 4 data points
- 1d Yield → 1d Fees/1d TVL (Yield % on LP capital)

How to Use It for LPing?

- Pools UP? More opportunities = healthier LP environment.
- 1d Yield > 3%? LPing is good to go despite fee dips.
- Imb DOWN? This is bullish—swaps are more evenly balanced across pools, reducing risk and creating more stable LP earnings.
- Imb HIGH? Means most volume is in just a few pools— it's imbalanced, be selective.
- 1d Vol DOWN? Could mean the market is slowing.

Example Honk Index Reading

- Pools: 42 (+13.8%) → More viable pools opening.
- Imb: 48.1% (-4.3%) → Swaps more evenly spread = healthier pools.
- 1d Vol: 159.1M (-9.4%) → Volume slowing down.
- 1d TVL: 21.8M (+10.0%) → More capital flowing in.
- 1d Fees: 719.4K (+20.2%) → Higher fees earned.
- 1d Yield: 3.31% (+9.2%) → Good to deploy liquidity.

 Even if fees drop, if yield is above 3%+, DLMM is still worth it.
