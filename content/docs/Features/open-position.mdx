**The process is very simple:**

- Enter the **CA (Contract Address)** of the token and specify how much **SOL** you want to LP with.
- MetEngine auto-swaps half your SOL into the token and creates a balanced LP position.
- The bot automatically selects the pool with the **highest 24h yield** for optimized returns.
- You can track and manage your positions anytime using the `/dlmm_positions` command.
