<b>The process is ver simple :</b>
   - Simply enter a CA (Contract Address) of the token  and the amount of SOL you want to provide as liquidity.
   - The bot automates swap and creates a position with half amount of SOL and the token swapped.
   - The bot selects the pool with Maximum number of 24 hrs Yield for better returns.
   - You can track and close the position using the `/positions` command.
