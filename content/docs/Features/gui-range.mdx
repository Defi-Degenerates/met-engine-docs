- After opening a position you must be worried if it gets out of range/how is it performing ,we have a solution for that too.
- When you use the /position command,you get all info about your current position which includes:
    1. <b>Name of the Pool</b> your position is in (Eg. JUP-SOL).
    2. <b>Total Deposit</b> : The value of the position in USD.
    3. <b>Total Unclaimed Fees</b> : The `Fees generated` by your LP in `USD` for both of the tokens(JUP and SOL in our case).
    4. <b>Impermanent Loss in USD</b> : You can see `IL` on your positions efforlessely and manage your loss accordingly.
    5. <b>Market Cap</b> : The Market cap of the tokens at which you entered and it's current MCap.
    6. <b>Meteora and Dexscreener</b> : links to view your position on Meteora or to see token insights/chart on Dexscreener.
    7. <b>Liquidity Distribution</b> : It shows your position in `form of bins`.
        - Eg : <br/>
            A. If all your sol is converted to to JUP then you’ll see all PINK colour bins.<br/>
            B. If you are in range then you’ll see the proposition of these bins acc to that,like if 70% of your SOL are converted to JUP then 70% of bins will be PINK and rest BLUE.
