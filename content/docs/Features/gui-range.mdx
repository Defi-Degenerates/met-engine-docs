After opening a position, you might wonder if it's in range or how it's performing. No worries - `/positions` shows everything you need.

**Here's what the position summary includes:**

- **Pool Name**: The pool you're currently LPing in (e.g., JUP-SOL).
- **Total Deposit**: Total position value in USD.
- **Unclaimed Fees**: Total fees you've earned in USD for both tokens (e.g., JUP and SOL).
- **Impermanent Loss (IL)**: Displays IL in USD to help manage risk.
- **Market Cap**: Market cap of tokens when entered and their current values.
- **Meteora + DexScreener Links**: Quick links to view your position directly or analyze token performance.
- **Liquidity Distribution**: Visual bin-based breakdown of where your liquidity lies.
  - **Example:**
    - If all your SOL has been converted to JUP, all bins will appear pink.
    - If you're still in range, you'll see a proportion of bins split (e.g., 70% JUP = 70% pink, rest blue).
- **Claim Fees**: Tap the button to collect all earned LP fees.
- **Refresh**: Pull the latest data to get up-to-date insights.
- **Close & Swap Back to SOL**: Instantly close your LP position and swap all assets back to SOL.
