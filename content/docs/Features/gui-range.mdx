- After opening the position you must be worried if it gets out of range,we have a solution for that too.
- When you use the /position command,you can check the range of your position in form of bin steps.
- Eg : 
    1. If all your sol is converted to to JUP then you’ll see all PINK colour bins.
    2. If you are in range then you’ll see the proposition of these bins acc to that,like if 70% of your SOL are converted to JUP then 70% of bins will be PINK and rest BLUE.
