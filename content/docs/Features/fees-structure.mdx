Running an efficient and advanced Telegram bot like Met Engine comes with various expenses, like:
    
    a. Server costs

    b. RPC costs (We use three different RPCs to ensure top-notch performance and a seamless user experience.)

    c. Developer costs

    d. UI/UX improvements and more

To cover these costs while keeping fees as low as possible for users, we have designed a fair and transparent fee structure that balances sustainability with affordability.


## Fee Structure

1. **Zero Fees on Swaps**: Every LP transaction involves 2-3 swaps. We use Jupiter Ultra for swaps, ensuring our users are protected from MEV while minimizing slippage.

2. **Zero Fees on Fees Generated**: Any fees you earn through liquidity providing (LPing) are entirely yours. Unlike other Telegram bots that take up to a 10% cut from generated fees, we do not take any share.

3. **Flat 1.5% Fee on Opening an LP Position**: We charge a flat 1.5% fee on successful opening an LP position. This fee grants you access to a suite of premium features, like:

    a. Claim fees

    b. Wallet tracking

    c. Position monitoring

    d. Impermanent loss tracking

    e. Market cap insights

    f. One-click position closure And more

4. **Zero Fees on Closing a Position**: You can close your LP position with a single click, claim your fees, and swap back to SOLâ€”all without any additional fees.

<Callout>Note: Many similar tools charge excessively high fees. We want to ensure that the Meteora community gets the best service without overpaying.</Callout>

Our current fee model is designed to cover infra costs and developer compensation while maintaining an optimal user experience. As Met Engine grows and attracts more users, we anticipate lowering fees further.
